# For the Case
Here are the 3D printable files make a case for the Pirate Audio Line out and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2w.

## To make the case:
3mf Files for 3D printing on an FDM printer (I used an Ender3 v2).

## You will also need: 
8 off plastic screws M2.5 by 6 mm 
4 off 2.5 mm spacers to go between the pi and the pirate audio line out, I had to cut mine to fit with a knife, they are about 9mm tall.

If there are any questions or modifications needed to the design, please message me.

# For the Code
For software use Volumio and a fab Plugin by AxLED which makes the hat work. Details in this thread: https://community.volumio.org/t/plugin-pirate-audio/44336
I modified 1 file, and added an image to make it look more like volumio, see in the folder "Code", the instructions for my modifications are in the file "Display.py".
