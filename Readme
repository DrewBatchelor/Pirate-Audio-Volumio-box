Here are the 3D printable files make a case for the Pirate Audio Line out.
I use mine with  Pirate Audio Line out hat and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2w
For software use Volumio and fab Plugin by AxLED which makes the Hat work. Details in this thread: https://community.volumio.org/t/plugin-pirate-audio/44336

To make:
3mf Files for 3D printing on an FDM printer (I used an Ender3v2).

To assemble you will also need: 
8 off plastic screws M2.5 by 6 mm 
4 off 2.5 mm spacers to go between the pi and the pirate audio line out, I had to cut mine to fit with a knife, they are about 9mm tall.

If there are any questions or modifications needed to the design, please message me.
